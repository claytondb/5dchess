## ⏱️ Core Concept

You are a **Temporal Fleet Commander** who perceives time non-linearly. When things go badly, you can send ships backward in time, creating new timeline branches where different outcomes are possible.

**The Twist:** You must win in ALL timelines. Creating branches gives you more chances, but also more battles to manage simultaneously.
