# 5D Chess: Multiverse Tactics

> "FTL: Faster Than Light" meets "5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel"

A real-time tactical spaceship combat game where you command a fleet across time and parallel universes. Send ships back in time to change the outcome of battles, but beware—your enemy can do the same.

## Core Concept

Imagine FTL's tense ship-to-ship combat, but with the mind-bending time travel mechanics of 5D Chess:

- **Real-time combat** with pause-to-plan (like FTL)
- **Time travel**: Send ships or commands back to earlier moments
- **Branching timelines**: Every time-jump creates a new parallel universe
- **Multiverse management**: Track and influence multiple simultaneous timelines
- **Victory condition**: Destroy the enemy flagship across ALL active timelines

## Inspiration

- **5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel** - Chess where pieces move through time and timelines
- **FTL: Faster Than Light** - Roguelike spaceship management with real-time combat
- **5D Diplomacy** - Multiplayer Diplomacy with time travel (see: youtube.com/watch?v=7fjwXLBJTLY)
